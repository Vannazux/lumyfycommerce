# Optional HTTPS server: to enable, mount certificates into the container at
# /etc/nginx/certs/fullchain.pem and /etc/nginx/certs/privkey.pem and open 443
# on the host. Example docker-compose hints are in docker-compose.yml.
# Optional HTTPS server should be provided as a separate file (not included here)
# to avoid Nginx failing when certificates are not present.
# Create a file at ./nginx/ssl.conf (and mount certs) or rename ssl.conf.disabled -> ssl.conf
# to enable HTTPS. See nginx/ssl.conf.disabled for an example.
